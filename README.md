# IntroResearchMethods-Final-Project
 
# Abstract:
Taboo language ETC.... and there is research to support both sides. 



# Background information:
Thelwall (2008) found no significant differences in the usage of strong swearing in its UK MySpace members, while there was a significant difference for the US members; US males used more strong swear words than US females.

Güvendir (2015) uses the claim that males generally use more strong swear words and papers about the neurobiology of swearing (such as EXAMPLE) to give an evolutionary explanation as to why males would be more likely to use swear words than females. It should be mentioned that Güvendir examines strong swear words specifically, whereas this study will focus on a more general view of swearing.

As a sidenote, Güvendir describes the difference between strong and mild swearing in the following way: "Although offensiveness of swear words depends on contextual variables, the primary purpose of strong swear words is to produce an undesired emotional influence on a listener while mild swear words do not intentionally aim to hurt the listener."


# Research question and hypothesis:
The specific research question that this study will focus on reads: “How does the frequency with which men and women use swear words in conversations with strangers, differ?”

Based on the prior literature described above, I hypothesize that men will use swear words more frequently than women. 

# Method:
The research will be carried out with the help of the Fisher corpus, which contains over 11000 recorded telephone conversations of English speaking participants. This group of participants consists of around 6800 female speakers and 5100 male speakers. The labeling of their sexes was done by auditing the conversations.

There are a few reasons that this method is not entirely watertight. Firstly, since the corpus dates from 2005, the results that will be found are applicable to that year, and do not reflect changes that may have happened in the decades thereafter.

Nonetheless the nature of the conversations in the Fisher corpus and the credible labeling of participant sexes make it an interesting and relatively suitable corpus to use for this research.

As for the swear word part of the research, the Fisher corpus will be scanned for ten(?) of the most common swear words according to Jay (2009) The list of taboo words used by Jay (2009) accounts for approximately 80% of the data used in that study.

Not all of these words are suitable for search, since they are not profanities by themselves, but only in context. One such phrase in Jay's list is the phrase "Jesus Christ".
