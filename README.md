# IntroResearchMethods-Final-Project
 
# Abstract:
Taboo language ETC.



# Background information:
Related work, such as LIST SOME PAPERS HERE. Güvendir (2015) combines these papers and papers about the neurobiology of swearing (such as EXAMPLE) 


# Research question and hypothesis:
The specific research question that this study will focus on reads: “How does the frequency with which swear words are used differ between men and women?” MAYBE SPECIFY AND ONLY LOOK AT CONVERSATIONS WITH STRANGERS.

Based on the prior literature described above, I hypothesize that men will use swear words more frequently than women. 

# Method:
The research will be carried out with the help of the Fisher corpus, which contains over 11000 recorded telephone conversations of participants. This group of participants consists of around 6800 female speakers and 5100 male speakers and the labeling of their sexes was done by auditing the conversations.

There are a few reasons that this method is not entirely watertight. Firstly, since the corpus dates from 2005, the results that will be found are applicable to that year, and do not reflect changes that may have happened in the decades thereafter.

Nonetheless the nature of the conversations in the Fisher corpus and the credible labeling of participant sexes make it an interesting and relatively suitable corpus to use for this research.
