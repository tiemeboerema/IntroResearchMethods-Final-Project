# Abstract:
Taboo language ETC.



# Background information:
Related work, such as LIST SOME PAPERS HERE. Güvendir (2015) combines these papers and papers about the neurobiology of swearing (such as EXAMPLE) to give an explanation as to why males would be more likely to use swear words than females. It should be mentioned that Güvendir examines "strong" swear words specifically, whereas this study will focus on a more general view of swearing.

As a sidenote, Güvendir describes the difference between strong and mild swearing in the following way: "Although offensiveness of swear words depends on contextual variables, the primary purpose of strong swear words is to produce an undesired emotional influence on a listener while mild swear words do not intentionally aim to hurt the listener."

Maybe write about the "stranger on a train" effect, since it might be applicable in a limited way.

# Research question and hypothesis:
The specific research question that this study will focus on reads: “How does the frequency with which men and women use swear words in conversations with strangers, differ?”

Based on the prior literature described above, I hypothesize that men will use swear words more frequently than women. 

# Method:
The research will be carried out with the help of the Fisher corpus, which contains over 11000 recorded telephone conversations of English speaking participants. This group of participants consists of around 6800 female speakers and 5100 male speakers. The labeling of their sexes was done by auditing the conversations.

There are a few reasons that this method is not entirely watertight. Firstly, since the corpus dates from 2005, the results that will be found are applicable to that year, and do not reflect changes that may have happened in the decades thereafter.

Nonetheless the nature of the conversations in the Fisher corpus and the credible labeling of participant sexes make it an interesting and relatively suitable corpus to use for this research.

As for the swear word part of the research, the Fisher corpus will be scanned for the five most common swear words according to ........... This amount was chosen as a middle-ground between potentially limiting or .......... amounts, such as two and ten.
