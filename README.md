# IntroResearchMethods-Final-Project
 
# Abstract:
Swearing is often associated with men, but research is not conclusive about the validity of this claim. Where some studies do find significant results showing males use more swear words, others nuance this claim by examining different strengths of swear words, which creates varying results.

This study will not be zooming in on these distinctions between swear words, instead it looks at a more formal way of conversing, namely the usage of swear words by males and females in conversations with strangers, by looking at a corpus of transcribed phone conversations between English-speaking participants. 

# Background information:
One study by Thelwall (2008) found no significant differences in the usage of strong swearing in its UK MySpace members, while there was a significant difference for the US members; US males used more strong swear words than US females. Gauthier & Guille (2017) note that while the use of swear words is traditionally associated with men, it is often not the frequency with which they are used that is different, but the context in which they are used and the strength of the swear words in question.

Güvendir (2015) uses the claim that males generally use more strong swear words and papers about the neurobiology of swearing, such as Kensinger & Corkin (2004), to give an evolutionary explanation as to why males would be more likely to use swear words than females. It should be mentioned that Güvendir examines strong swear words specifically, whereas this study will focus on a more general view of swearing.

As a sidenote, Güvendir describes the difference between strong and mild swearing in the following way: "Although offensiveness of swear words depends on contextual variables, the primary purpose of strong swear words is to produce an undesired emotional influence on a listener while mild swear words do not intentionally aim to hurt the listener."

# Research question and hypothesis:
The specific research question that this study will focus on reads: “How does the frequency with which males and females use swear words in conversations with strangers, differ?”

Based on the prior literature described above, I hypothesize that there may be a slight difference favoring men in swear word usage, since this study will not differentiate between the strength of the swear word used.

# Method:
The research will be carried out with the help of the Fisher corpus, which contains over 11000 recorded telephone conversations of English speaking participants. This group of participants consists of around 6800 female speakers and 5100 male speakers. The labeling of their sexes was done by auditing the conversations.

There are a few reasons that this method is not entirely watertight. Firstly, since the corpus dates from 2005, the results that will be found are applicable to that year, and do not reflect changes that may have happened in the decades thereafter.

Nonetheless the nature of the conversations in the Fisher corpus and the credible labeling of participant sexes make it an interesting and relatively suitable corpus to use for this research.

As for the swear word part of the research, the Fisher corpus will be scanned for ten(?) of the most common swear words according to Jay (2009) The list of taboo words used by Jay (2009) accounts for approximately 80% of the data used in that study.

Not all of these words are suitable for search, since they are not profanities by themselves, but only in context. One such phrase in Jay's list is the phrase "Jesus Christ".
